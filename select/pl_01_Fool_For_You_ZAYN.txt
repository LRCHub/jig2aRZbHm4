This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way you know what I mean
And where the dark turns to mist
I just can't resist it
Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things
The things you do
The things you do
The things you do
When you looking like this
I just can't resist it
You know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time
because its gonna to defeat me
But you won't
Believe me believe me
Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things
The things you do
I know I know
Given the chance I'd do it again, I
Cause I can't help myself
Cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you
Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things
The things you do
This love is tainted
