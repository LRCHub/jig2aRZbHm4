If you really need
to know how I feel about you,
baby
Just let me put this
on your mind
You know there's never been
a question
The way we feel about each other
From that moment you
made me laugh
I knew I was falling in love
Oh, if I could do it again
I wouldn't change
it for nothing
You're a very special
part of my life
You took me hand in hand
And made me your wife
I don't care if people say that
I'm a fool for loving you
'Cause your love
it takes me up to the sky
And it feels
so good that I can't deny
'Cause my heart
It's on a natural high
And I just can't deny
what I'm feeling inside
'Cause your love
it takes me over the Moon
And I won't
ain't coming down no time soon
I can't see me without you
And I'm telling you
Listen to me baby
The way you shower me
with affection
Your presence is a blessing
to me
You're so unselfish
with your love
Ooh, you're giving me more
than enough
If I had to do it,
I wouldn't change a thing, no
'Cause you showed up right
on time
Took me by the hand
Made me your wife
I don't care if people say that
I'm a fool for loving you
'Cause your love
it takes me up to the sky
And it feels
so good that I can't deny
And my heart
It's on a natural high
And I just can't deny what
I'm feeling inside
'Cause your love
it takes me over the Moon
And I won't
ain't coming down no time soon
I can't see me without you
And I'm telling you
Listen to me baby
I will never stop loving you, no
While you make me feel
so brand new
Another one, all I need
All I want is my life
That's why I don't care
I don't care if people say
That I'm a fool for loving you
Your love
it takes me up to the sky
it takes me up to the sky
So good that I can't deny
And it feels good I can't deny
It's on a natural high
And I'm on a natural high
And I just can't deny
what I'm feeling inside
'Cause your love
it takes me over the Moon
it takes me over the Moon
Ain't coming down no time soon
And I ain't coming down
no time soon
I can't see me without you
Just can't see me
without you baby
And I'm telling you
Listen to me baby
No I don't really care
if people say
That I'm a fool
for loving you, no
