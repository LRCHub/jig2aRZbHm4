It's somethin' 'bout you
That's so familiar
Somethin' that's got me
Wantin' to know you
And I can't put my finger on it
But it feels,
Oh like I've been here before
It's somethin' about me
that makes me wonder
I swear I met you,
but you're a stranger
And I can't put my finger on
quite what it is
Oh, but I've been here before
Maybe it was me who brought you
here
I should run the other way,
but I stay right here
And I'll be a fool for you
I know myself, but I pretend
I leave and I come back again
I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story
ends, oh
Oh, you remind me of someone I
once knew
Maybe I'm crazy
but It's hard to ignore you
And I can't wrap my head
around it
But it feels,
oh I like I loved you before
Maybe it was me who brought you
here
I should run the other way,
but I stay right here
And I'll be a fool for you
I know myself, but I pretend
I leave and I come back again
I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story
ends, oh
Say
You know that I'll be
that fool for you
And I'll be a fool for you
I know myself, but I pretend
I leave and I come back again
I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story
ends, oh
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye
Oh, I, I, I
Oh, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
