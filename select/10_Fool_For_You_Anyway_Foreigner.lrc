[00:13.81] Well I miss you honey
[00:18.35] A little more every day
[00:27.38] And I know if I kissed you
[00:32.53] You'd be comin' back home to stay
[00:49.03] 
[00:40.69] 'Cause I know I was wrong
[00:44.85] But how long do I have to pay?
[00:59.85] 
[00:55.06] You know you belong here beside me
[00:59.41] I'm a fool for you anyway
[01:06.08] I'm a fool for you anyway
[01:13.27] 'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway
[01:29.27] 
[01:21.39] Well I cried for you so long
[01:26.21] My river of tears ran dry
[01:34.50] And I tried to be so strong
[01:39.72] But grew weaker as time went by
[01:55.22] 
[01:48.29] You know your love left a mark on me
[01:52.86] I don't think it will fade away
[02:08.36] 
[02:02.62] I'll sit here and wait 'til you come home
[02:06.63] 'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway
[02:13.55] I'm a fool for you anyway
[02:20.40] Fool for you anyway
[02:29.90] 
[02:48.21] (You know your love left a mark on me) on me
[02:51.84] I don't think it will fade away
[03:07.34] 
[03:03.60] I'll sit here and wait 'til you come home
[03:08.44] 'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway
[03:15.12] Yes, I'm a fool for you anyway
[03:22.67] I'm a fool for you anyway
[03:35.17] 
[03:29.51] Fool for you anyway
[03:35.53] Fool for you anyway
[03:42.02] Yes, I'm a fool for you anyway
[03:48.83] I'm a fool for you anyway
[03:55.51] Fool for you anyway
[04:01.44] I'm a fool for you anyway
