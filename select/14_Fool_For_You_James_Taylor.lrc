[00:04.59] My lady don't allow the life i lead,
[00:09.15] She don't abide by some
[00:10.09] Of the company that i keep.
[00:12.82] She takes occasion to criticize, and carry on.
[00:15.58] I love her so, i just can't stand it no more,
[00:19.13] I'm a fool for you babe, don't you know,
[00:22.88] Mess around momma, i'm a fool for you momma, oo.
[00:25.65] I should say, my baby knows
[00:37.34] That i'm crazy bout her loving.
[00:40.18] That's all right,
[00:41.97] She takes unfair advantage now and then.
[00:44.65] She jumps at the chance to tease me with her body.
[00:49.26] Lord, i love that thing so,
[00:51.96] Just can't stand it no more,
[00:53.75] I'm a fool for you babe,
[00:57.46] Look around, momma,
[00:59.22] I'm a fool for you.
[01:01.09] Have a sweet thing today.
