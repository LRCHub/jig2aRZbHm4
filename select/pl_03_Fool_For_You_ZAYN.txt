I was looking like a fool
when I met ya
All covered up
in the dirt from my past
So insecure about myself
when I met ya
Won't you give me
any warning?
I've been thinking 'bout you
day and night, day and night
To be honest
I just don't know
what to do next
'Cause I'm the one
with the broken heart
Waiting for you
to come out and save me
I'm a mess,
need to untangle
And I'm a fool for ya baby,
fool, fool for ya baby
Waiting for you
to come out and save me
Fool for ya
You were making me so sure
in a heartbeat
All of my doubts
disappearing at last
You made me fall
without saying a sentence
Won't you give me
any warning?
I've been thinking 'bout you
day and night, day and night
To be honest
I just don't know
what to do next
'Cause I'm the one
with the broken heart
Waiting for you
to come out and save me
I'm a mess,
need to untangle
And I'm a fool for ya baby,
fool, fool for ya baby
Waiting for you
to come out and save me
Fool for ya
I know, I know, I know
it isn't logical
That something
that you do to me is chemical
I know, I know, I know
it isn't logical
Something that you do to me
I'm the one
with the broken heart
Waiting for you
to come out and save me
I'm a mess,
need to untangle
And I'm a fool for ya baby,
fool, fool for ya baby
Waiting for you
to come out and save me
Fool for ya
