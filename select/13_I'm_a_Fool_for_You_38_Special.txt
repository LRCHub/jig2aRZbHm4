I fooled around just a little too long,
Caught me by surprise.
All I did was to sit right down,
Stare into your eyes.
So the world has passed you by,
And all that's not been said.
Saw you in my days and nights,
And everything ahead.

I'm a fool for you baby.
There ain't no end in sight.
Just a fool for you baby.
And I'll be your fool tonight.

Well I've been down this crazy road,
But not like this before.
Had the blues when I heard the news,
But I'm not worried no more.

I'm a fool for you baby.
There ain't no end in sight.
Just a fool for your baby.
And I'll be your fool tonight.

Fool for you baby.
Fool for you baby.

I fooled around just a little too long.
It caught me by surprise.
All I did was to sit right down,
Stare into your eyes.

I'm a fool for you baby.
There ain't no end in sight.
Just a fool for you baby.
And I'll be your fool tonight.

Well I'm a fool for you baby.
There ain't no end in sight.
Just a fool for you baby.
And I'll be your fool tonight.

I'm a fool for you baby.
There ain't no end in sight.
Just a fool for you baby.
And I'll be your fool tonight.
