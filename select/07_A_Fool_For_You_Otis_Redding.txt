I know you told me, long time ago
That you didn't want me, yeah
You didn't love me no more

But I know it was something, oh, that made me blue
But believe me, child, I've been a fool for you
I've been a big fool for you

I know you told me, yeah
You didn't want me around
I know that you had a big ol' man right there
In an apartment way across town
And I know it's something that makes me blue
Believe me child, I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you

Now did you ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day, yeah, uh
Reach over and feel your pillow
Where that lil fine fuck used to lay
Ever since I was 5 years old, baby
I've been a, a fool for you
Way down, deep down in my soul
I've been a fool for you

Well I know it's something, oh, what makes me blue
Believe me child, I've been a fool for you

I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you

I've been just so bad, yeah
I've been just so bad

You don't know what you're doing to me
Well, I just can't understand, yeah
No, no, no, baby, yeah

I've been a fool for you honey now
I've been a quite big fool for you, baby
A fool for you mama.
