```lrc
[00:13.12] This love is tainted
[00:19.10] I need you and I hate it
[00:25.35] You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
[00:31.51] In a way, you know what I mean
[00:37.67] When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it
[01:01.67] 
[00:48.01] Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
[01:00.56] Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
[01:12.38] The things you do, the things you do
[01:30.38] 
[01:26.59] When you're looking like this
[01:30.37] I just can't resist it
[01:35.10] I know sometimes I hide it
[01:37.83] But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me
[01:41.81] But if you won't believe me, believe me
[02:01.31] 
[01:49.41] Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
[02:02.08] Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
[02:14.20] The things you do, the things you do
[02:32.20] 
[02:16.45] I know, I know given a chance I'd do it again
[02:26.35] Cause I can't help myself
[02:29.45] Cause I can't stop myself
[02:33.65] I just love being a fool for you-oh-oh
[02:52.65] 
[02:38.88] Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
[02:51.32] Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
[03:03.62] The things you do, the things you do
[03:21.62] 
[03:06.23] This love is tainted
